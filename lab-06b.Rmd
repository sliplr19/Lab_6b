### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
#install.packages("mosaicData")
library(mosaicData) 
```

### Exercise 1

```{r load_data}
data(Whickham)
```
I think this is an observational study. This is because I highly doubt they introduced smoking to certain people as an experimental condition and saw if they died. Instead, I think they observed people who were already smokers and non-smokers to check their living status.
